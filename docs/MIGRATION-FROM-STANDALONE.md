# Migration from the standalone repository

The current Campus Experts repository was originally a standalone snapshot of
`badger/badgerfactory`. The maintained fork model keeps the Campus workflow
but receives future badge runtime and hardware changes through
`badger/home`.

## For teams with no local work

1. Fork this Campus Experts repository. (ce-badge-universe26-hack-OFFICIAL)
2. Invite the other team members to that shared fork.
3. Clone the shared fork and add the maintained Campus repository as `upstream`.
4. Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) from the team-folder step.

## For teams with local work

Do not copy the whole old checkout into the new repository. Copy only:

- the team's assigned `TeamN/<app-name>/` directories;
- app-specific documentation that belongs with those apps;
- app-owned assets that are not generated or secret.

Before copying, remove `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.badge_state/`,
screenshots, editor files, and any credentials. Then run the app validator and
team-wide validator in the new checkout.

## Before opening the final pull request

- Confirm all app changes are inside the assigned team folder.
- Update the team fork from `upstream/main`.
- Run `validate_app.py` for each app.
- Run `validate_submissions.py TeamN`.
- Test in the [Pimoroni Badgeware Web Simulator](https://pimoroni.github.io/badgeware-web-simulator/).
- List all physical-badge checks that remain.

The old standalone repository should remain available as a historical
reference until all active teams have moved. New work should use the
maintained fork chain described in [UPSTREAM-SYNC.md](UPSTREAM-SYNC.md).
